There is an island consisting of squares. The island is a field, mountain or river (lake). Each square is entirely occupied by the terrain of one of these species.
Time moves in cycles. In one cycle on each square it can rain and shine the sun, and as a result - juicy grass grows.
## Build Setup
    # install dependencies
    $ npm install
    
    # serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
    $ npm run dev
    
    # build for production and launch server
    $ npm run build
After you build the application, the dependency files will be located in the **dist** directory. You can simply open **index.html** and the project will work.
